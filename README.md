Hi! Welcome to my first ever coding experience through The Odin Project.
I have a little bit of previous experience (I completed FCC's HTML+CSS curriculum), but want to rehash and get a good grip on also using GIT and Github more intently. 

This project will entail the following:
A simple display of the HTML skills that have been gathered through TOP.
A recipe page.
